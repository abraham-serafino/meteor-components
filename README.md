Meteor Components
=================

Recently Web Components have become "all the rage." On my LinkedIn Pulse, I've shown you how to quickly and easily add Polymer to your MeteorJS webapp, but you can also see how to use Meteor to throw together a components-like architecture without any plugins or polyfills.

This example also includes rudimentary, two-way data binding using the "data-model" attribute.

Setup
=====

You will need to:

<pre>meteor add reactive-var erasaur:meteor-lodash</pre>

in order to get the example to work.
